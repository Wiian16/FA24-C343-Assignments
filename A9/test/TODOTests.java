    // The current test cases are fragile, testing the string representation of
    // the output of the algorithms. This is not a good practice because the
    // output of the algorithms may change slightly and the tests will fail.
    // In particular, the output of the algorithms may change due to changes in
    // the order in which the nodes are visited.
    //
    // 1. Consider improving the existing test cases especially if your code returns
    // the correct results but in a slightly different order.
    //
    // 2. Create two new graphs of at least 10 nodes and 15 edges each and
    // Feel free to share the graphs on discord for others to use in their test cases
    //
    // 3. Using new graphs, write one additional test case for each algorithm
